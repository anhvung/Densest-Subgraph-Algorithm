# Densest-Subgraph-Algorithm

We know that finding the optimum **densest subgraph** can be computed in polynomial time. 

We show how to implement an algorithm that computes an approximation of the densest subgraph in **linear time** of the input. 

**A 2-approximation greedy algorithm was implemented in Python and C++**
