# Densest-Subgraph-Algorithm

Finding the optimum **densest subgraph** can be computed in polynomial time. However, large graphs require faster running time complexity.
This is an implementation of an algorithm that computes an approximation of the densest subgraph in **linear time** of the input. 

**A 2-approximation greedy algorithm was implemented in Python and C++**
